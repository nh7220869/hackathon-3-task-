## Project Overview
Welcome to the [Your Project Title] repository! This project is designed to [describe the main functionality or purpose of your project, e.g., an e-commerce platform, a personal portfolio, etc.]. 

### Key Features:
- [Feature 1: e.g., User authentication with Clerk]
- [Feature 2: e.g., Dynamic product listing]
- [Feature 3: e.g., Stripe payment integration]
- [Feature 4: e.g., Secure shipping API integration]
  
## Deployment Steps
Follow these steps to deploy the project to a hosting platform.

### 1. Choose a Platform:
We use [Vercel/Netlify/AWS/Azure] for quick deployment:
- **Platform Chosen:** [Vercel/Netlify]
- **Deployment type:** Simple for staging and production environments.

### 2. Connect Repository:
Link your GitHub repository to the hosting platform and ensure build settings are configured properly:
- Navigate to your hosting platform's dashboard.
- Connect your GitHub repository.
- Configure the build settings (typically automatic for most platforms).
- Add deployment scripts if needed (e.g., `npm run build`).

### 3. Configure Environment Variables:
Environment variables are stored in a `.env` file and must be uploaded to the hosting platform to manage sensitive data:
- Create a `.env` file and add necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, tokens):
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

- **Important environment variables**:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` — Your Sanity project ID.
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — Clerk API Key for user authentication.
    - `SHIPENGINE_API_KEY` — Key for ShipEngine API to handle shipping logistics.
    - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — Stripe API key for payment integration.

- Upload these variables securely to the hosting platform (e.g., in the dashboard of Vercel or Netlify).

### 4. Deploy to Staging:
Deploy the application to a staging environment on the hosting platform:
- Ensure the build process completes without errors.
- Verify basic functionality (e.g., navigation, product listing).

### 5. Staging Environment Testing:
Conduct testing on the staging environment before deploying to production:
- **Functional Testing:** Test core features like product listing, cart operations, etc.
- **Performance Testing:** Use tools like Lighthouse to check speed and responsiveness.
- **Security Testing:** Check for vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, HTTPS usage).
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Ensure compatibility across multiple browsers and devices.

### 6. Deploy to Production:
Once testing is successful, deploy to the production environment:
- Monitor application performance and resolve any issues that arise.
