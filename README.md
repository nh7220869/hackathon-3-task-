# Deployment Preparation and Staging Environment Setup

## Objective
This document outlines the steps for preparing and deploying the marketplace application. The focus is on setting up a staging environment, configuring hosting, and ensuring an optimized deployment for a seamless customer experience.

## Step 1: Hosting Platform Setup

### **Choosing a Platform**
Vercel has been selected due to its:
- Fast and simple deployment with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket integration.
- Optimization for frontend frameworks like Next.js, React, and Vue.js.
- Global edge network for fast content delivery.
- Automatic scaling and free SSL with custom domain support.

### **Connecting GitHub Repository to Vercel**
1. **Sign in to Vercel** – Log in using a GitHub account.
2. **Import Repository** – Click "New Project" and select the repository.
3. **Configure Build Settings** – Auto-detect framework or set a custom build command (`npm run build`).
4. **Set Environment Variables** – Add required API keys and secrets.
5. **Deploy the Project** – Click "Deploy" to build and go live.

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

### **Creating a .env File**
A `.env` file stores sensitive environment variables securely. Example:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="your_sanity_project_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_stripe_publishable_key"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your_stripe_secret_key"
```

### **Uploading Variables to Vercel**
1. Go to the project dashboard on Vercel.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
3. Add the variables and set them to "Production" or "Preview".
4. Click **Save**.

## Step 3: Deploy to Staging

### **Deploying Application**
1. Log in to Vercel and navigate to the project.
2. Connect the GitHub repository (if not done earlier).
3. Click **Deploy** to launch the staging environment.
4. Validate deployment with the staging URL (`your-project-name.vercel.app`).

### **Validating Deployment**
- Check for build errors in the Vercel dashboard.
- Verify UI, API calls, and overall functionality.
- Ensure the deployed version matches the latest code.

## Step 4: Staging Environment Testing

### **Testing Types**
- **Product Listing:** Check product display, pagination, sorting, and availability.
- **Search Functionality:** Validate search results, filters, and edge cases.
- **Cart Operations:** Test adding, updating, and removing items from the cart.
- **Checkout Process:** Verify shipping details, payment processing, and order confirmation.
- **User Authentication:** Ensure login, signup, password reset, and profile updates function correctly.
- **Responsive Design:** Test UI responsiveness on various devices.
- **Security and Privacy:** Check data protection and session management.

### **Test Case Reporting**
- Document testing results in a CSV file.
- Track issues and fixes to ensure deployment readiness.

## Step 5: Performance Testing
- Use **Lighthouse** or **GTmetrix** to analyze page load speed and interactivity.
- Optimize for fast performance across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Conclusion
The above steps ensure a seamless transition from development to live deployment. By following this process, the application is well-optimized, secure, and production-ready for users.
